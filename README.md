This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Urban Graph
A React component that abstracts painstaking graph creation into a single class with easy-to-use props and a variety of customisation possiblities.

## Usage
This component is being built on top of [devextreme-react's chart library](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Charts/Line/React/) and **UrbanGraph** will be published as an npm package eventually. 

### Using the repository
To use this current repository, use `npm start` or `yarn start` in the terminal, at the root of this project to start the development server on https://localhost:3000. 
Any saved changes made to the source code will cause the development build to refresh with the changes implemented.

You may look at the source code for [UrbanGraph.js](./src/UrbanGraph/UrbanGraph.js) to understand the prop requirements through the chart implementation or usage of PropTypes at the bottom of the file.
